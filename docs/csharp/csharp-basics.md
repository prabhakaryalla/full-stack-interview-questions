#### What is Method Overloading and Overriding?
##### Method Overloading
Method Overloading is a type of polymorphism. It has several names like “Compile Time Polymorphism” or “Static Polymorphism,” and sometimes it is called “Early Binding”.

Method Overloading means creating multiple methods in a class with the same names but different signatures (Parameters). It permits a class, struct, or interface to declare multiple methods with the same name with unique signatures.

##### Method Overriding
Method Overriding is a type of polymorphism. It has several names like “Run Time Polymorphism” or “Dynamic Polymorphism,” and sometimes it is called “Late Binding”. 

Method Overriding means having two methods with the same name and same signatures [parameters]; one should be in the base class, and another method should be in a derived class [child class]. You can override the functionality of a base class method to create the same name method with the same signature in a derived class. You can achieve method overriding using inheritance. Virtual and Override keywords are used to achieve method overriding.

#### What are Delegates?

##### Delegate 
- It is a reference type.
- It is a function pointer or it holds a reference (pointer) to a function (method).
- It is type safe.
- Delegates are mainly used for the event handling and the callback methods.
