### Design for Goverance

**Azure Acconts Hierarchy**

**Management Groups**

Microsoft bought management groups in to ease the management of subscriptions and resource groups underneath. So, we can set things like policy at the management group level, which in turn flows down through sub management groups and sub subscriptions.

The other key thing to be aware of is the account subscription relationship.

### Resource Groups
A Resource Group in Azure is nothing but a logical container where you are creating your Azure resources. A resource group created in a specific region can contain the resources created in the other regions. There is no restriction on that.

Resource groups are also called the central unit that acts like a logical container that holds all the Azure resources.

When we go and destroy a resource group, you can destroy everything in it.

### Why Resource Groups

- Organization
- Easy de-provisioning - we need not go every object and destroy it
- Security boundary  - We can give people rights at the resource group level, we can give rights at subsrciption level
  * RBAC
- Apply Policies - for ex, In this RG you can only deploy workloads of exercise. And if you try to do it, even though though you have rights to do it, it will stop you.

### Resource Groups and Tagging

Apply tags to your Azure resources to logically organize them by categories. A tag consists of a key (name) and a value.

We can apply Tags at RG level also.

**Overview of Resource Group**
![RG Overview](./images/RG-overview.jpg)

*Activity log:* We can see the activity log updates here

*Access Control:* We can assign permissions here. We can add role assignments directly to the resource groups. so think this is an another boundary for given access.

*Events:* These are used to trigger the associated things like logic apps, event grid, etc., 

*Resource Cost:* we can see the the costs of the resources.

*Deployments:* We can go and see the deployments occured in that resource group.

*Policies:* Policies are very much same as we apply policy to subscription. we can assign a policy or group of policies via initiative. For example resource group restricting virtual machine instance SKUs that are allowed to provision, ensforce some type of encription. Those thing we cannot do on the resource group.

*Automation script:* Here we can download the template for all the resources that are actually in there. It is really a download in that resource group as an ARM template.

*New Support Request:*  we can direct submit the support request directly from the resource group as well.

### Role Based Access Controls

**Azure RBAC Built-in Roles**
![RBAC Buil-in Roles](./images/RBAC-builtinRoles.jpg)

![RBAC Buil-in Roles Continued](./images/RBAC-builtinRoles-2.jpg)

- Roles include various actions
- Action defines what type of operations you can perform on a given resource group
  * Write enables you to perform PUT, POST, PATCH and DELETE operations
  * Read enables you to perform GET operations
-  Use powershell to get the latest roles

   [Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azroledefinition?view=azps-9.5.0)

   ```ps1
   Get-AzRoleDefinition  #Lists all Azure RBAC roles that are available for assignment. 
   ```

   **RBAC Custom Roles**
   - Create if none of built-in roles work for you
   - Each tenant can have 2000 roles
   - use "Actions" and "Non-Actions"
   - Assignable Scopes
     * Subscriptions
     * Resource Groups
     * Individual Resoources
     * Management Groups

### Azure Resource Locks
- Mechanism to lock the resources you want to ensure an extra layer of protection before they can be deleted.

- 2 options available

  * **CanNot Delete:** Authorized users can read and modify but not delete the resource.
  * **ReadOnly:** Authorized users can read the resource but cannot update or delete.

### **Design Authentication**


### Domain services Overview
There mainily 3 major options available when we are trying to deal with authentication in active directory. 

1. **Azure AD(AAD):** Microsoft has released with Azure and Office 365 which is Azure AD or Azure Active Directory. This is the primary mechanism now and should be our first choice generally when trying to develop any new service use their authentication mechanism.

2. **Active Directory Domain Services:** This is where you might install a Window Server 2016 or Windows Server 2012 you might have one run it in on premise and you do a DC promo on that server and it sets up your directory service. So, if you are in an enterprise, you probably used to login on to your laptop and you authenticating against Active Directory

3. **Azure Active Directory Domain Services:** This is where we have a managed version of Active Directory Domain Services. If we want fully managed, microsoft will built that domain controller, maintain it. thats what AADDS are.


### AAD
-  Modern AD Service built directly for Cloud
- Often same as O365 directory service
- Can sync with On-premises directory service.

### ADDS
- Legacy Active Directory since windiws 2000
- Traditional Kerberos and LDAP functionality
- Deployed on windows OS usually on VMs

### AADDS
- Provides managed domain services
- Allows to you consume domain services without the need to patch and maintain domain controller on IaaS.
-  Domain Join, Group Polict, LDAP, Kerberos, NTLM; all supported.


### AAD Overview
Azure Active Directory is kind of central hub how for all your identity. we can see from the below image that it's got links to On-premises so that we can talk to say our Window Server Active Directory or other directories and lots of other services like we can use Google logon or other logon and connect them into Azure AD. So this other identity sources that we want pull in and that's using things like Azure ADB2C. 

We can also see at the top there in image, we have got the concept of simple connection, a connection to the On-premise services. Azure AD Connect is something that we definetly to learn for self services. These are features which allows users to say go on to a portal and reset a password, given them lof of self service capabilities so that we dont have to take calls every time somebody needs something. We have also single signon capability so perhaps i sign in with my Azure Ad account and then i am logged into multiple services perhaps Azure and O365 other services that are without me having to keep login with other username and password.




**Key features of Azure AD**



### AD Connect

#### AD Connect overview

**AD Connect Components**

*Synchronization Service:* This component is responsible for creating the users, groups and other objects in AAD. It is also responsible for making sure identity information for your on-premiers users and groups is completely matching the cloud.

*Active Directory Federation Service (optional):* It has also an option for Active Directory Federation service. SO this is optional and federation really allows us to configure a hybrid environment using on-premises ADFS infrastructure. This can be used by organizations to address more complex type deployments such as domain Join us or we have third party MFA's solutions.

*Health Monitoring:* This is called Azure AD Connect Health. This provides robust monitoring and provides a central location in Azure to view your health activity and make sure your domains are in sync and there's no issues.

#### Azure AD Sync Features

- **Filtering:** This is used when we want to limit which objects are synchronized to AAD. By default all users, contacts, groups and windows 10 computer are only synchronized. We can change this filtering based on domains, organization units or other attributes if we want to.
- **Password Hash Synchronization:** This synchronizes the password hash in our on-prem active directory to AAD. The end user can use the same password on premise and in the cloud, but have to manage it in one location since it uses your on-prem active directory as the authority. You can also use your own password policy that you decide to implement in your our on-prem active directory  
- **Password Writeback:** This will allow users to change and reset passwords in the cloud and this would write back to our on premises.
- **Device Writeback:** This allow registered device in ADFS to be written back to your on-prem active directory so that it can be used as conditional access.
- **Prevent accidental deletes:** This is turned on default. This protects your cloud directory from numerous deletes at the same time. By default it allows 500 deletes per run and you can change the setting based on your organization.
- **Automatic upgrade:** By default enabled for the express set installations and this ensures your AAD connect infrastructure is always up to date with the latest release.

#### Password Sync Options:
- **Password Sync** - Ensures user passwords are the same in both directories (AD DS and Azure AD)
- **Passthrough Authentication** - Easy method to keep users and passwords aligned. When a user logs into Azure AD, the request is forwarded to AD DS. Essentially, a single source.
- **AD FS** - Use AD Federation Service server to fully federate across AD DS and Azure AD, along with other services. Perhaps serviceNow as an example, the SAS service, a lot of people use ticket things like that.Perhaps it uses ADFS and its Federated with your AD DS
